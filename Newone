Design document for single sign on project using java, spring boot , JSP 
ChatGPT
Sure, here's a high-level design document for a Single Sign-On (SSO) project using Java, Spring Boot, and JSP:

Design Document for Single Sign-On (SSO) Project
1. Introduction
This document outlines the design of a Single Sign-On (SSO) system using Java, Spring Boot, and JSP. The SSO system allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications without re-entering credentials.

2. Objectives
Implement SSO for seamless authentication across multiple applications.
Use Spring Boot for backend services.
Use JSP for the front-end views.
Ensure secure handling of user credentials and tokens.
3. Architecture Overview
The architecture comprises the following components:

Authentication Server: Manages user authentication and issues tokens.
Client Applications: Trust the authentication server and use the tokens for user authentication.
Token Storage: Secure storage for tokens.
4. Technology Stack
Java 17
Spring Boot 3.x
Spring Security
JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
JSP (JavaServer Pages)
MySQL/PostgreSQL (or any other relational database)
Redis (for token storage, if needed)
Maven/Gradle (for project management)
5. Authentication Flow
User Request: User accesses a protected resource on a client application.
Redirection: User is redirected to the authentication server if not already authenticated.
Login: User enters credentials on the authentication server.
Token Issuance: Upon successful authentication, the server issues a JWT.
Token Storage: Token is stored securely on the client side (typically in a cookie or local storage).
Resource Access: User is redirected back to the client application with the token, and access is granted to the protected resource.
6. Detailed Design
6.1 Authentication Server
Controller: Manages login requests and token issuance.
Service: Handles business logic for authentication and token management.
Repository: Interacts with the database for user details.
Security Configuration: Configures Spring Security for authentication
and authorization.
6.2 Client Applications
Controller: Handles requests for protected resources.
Service: Interacts with the authentication server for token validation.
Interceptor: Intercepts requests to check for valid tokens before allowing access
6.3 Token Management
JWT Utility: Generates and validates JWT tokens.
Redis Configuration: Optional, for storing tokens in Redis.
7. User Interface
Login Page: JSP page for user login.
Error Page: JSP page for error handling.
