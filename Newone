Here's a summary of session management in a Java Spring Boot web application:

Basic Configuration:

Session Timeout: Set the session timeout period in application.properties (e.g., server.servlet.session.timeout=30m).
Spring Security Configuration: Define session management in your security configuration, including setting session creation policies, handling concurrent sessions, and configuring logout behavior.
Single Active Session:

Custom Session Listener: Implement HttpSessionListener to track and manage active sessions using a concurrent data structure.
Custom Authentication Filter: Extend UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter to check for existing sessions and manage new session creation.
Integrate Filter: Configure Spring Security to use the custom authentication filter.
Session Expiration and Termination:

Session Expiration: Automatically handled by Spring Security based on the timeout configuration. Customize redirection for expired sessions.
Session Termination: Sessions are invalidated on logout and will expire based on the timeout setting.
Custom Session Management:

Session Attributes: Use HttpSession to store and manage session attributes in your controllers.
This setup ensures proper session handling, including single session enforcement, timeout management, and custom session data handling.
